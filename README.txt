This is a basic vision project directory that contains:

- various image reading routines
- a basic pixel representation data structure
- a demo version of something close to a Canny edge detector
- a colour image region segmentation scheme that use peaks in the distance transform of the edge map as seeds for colour region growing.

- some matlab/octave bits for displaying run length map image output.
